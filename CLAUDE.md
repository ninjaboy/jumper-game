# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview
This is a simple Node.js game project for learning different jump mechanics. The game features a controllable rectangle character that can move and jump using WASD, arrow keys, or spacebar controls.

## Development Commands
- `npm install` - Install dependencies
- `npm start` - Start the game development server
- `npm run dev` - Start with auto-reload for development

## Project Structure
**All files in ROOT directory:**
- `game.js` - Main game logic and engine
- `player.js` - Player character implementation
- `physics.js` - Physics and movement mechanics
- `platforms.js` - Platform and hazard management
- `consumables.js` - Consumable/powerup system
- `index.html` - Game canvas and HTML structure
- `server.js` - Local development server (Express)
- `package.json` - Project dependencies and scripts
- `vercel.json` - Vercel deployment config
- `CLAUDE.md` - This file
- `VERSION_PROTOCOL.md` - Version update guidelines

**Important:** All game code lives in ROOT. No public/ directory. Keep it simple.

## Game Framework
Uses a lightweight HTML5 Canvas-based game framework for simplicity and educational purposes. The game loop handles rendering, input, and physics updates at 60 FPS.

## Key Concepts
- Gravity and physics simulation
- Input handling for multiple control schemes
- Jump mechanics with customizable parameters
- Frame-based animation and movement
- Consumable system for powerups and abilities

## ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT: Version Management
**When making ANY code changes to game features:**
1. Update version number in `game.js` constructor (line 4)
2. Add version note to `this.versionNotes` array (lines 5-10)
3. Follow semantic versioning (see VERSION_PROTOCOL.md)
4. Include version in commit message

**Quick Reference:**
- New feature ‚Üí Bump MINOR (1.1.0 ‚Üí 1.2.0)
- Bug fix ‚Üí Bump PATCH (1.1.0 ‚Üí 1.1.1)
- Major overhaul ‚Üí Bump MAJOR (1.1.0 ‚Üí 2.0.0)

See `VERSION_PROTOCOL.md` for complete guidelines.

## üö® CRITICAL: Deployment Rules

### Primary Deployment Method (Preferred)
**GitHub auto-deployment:**
- Push to master branch: `git push`
- Vercel automatically deploys (usually 30-60 seconds)
- This is the preferred method for normal development

### Manual Deployment (On-Demand Only)
**Use ONLY when:**
- User explicitly requests deployment
- GitHub auto-deploy is failing or rate-limited
- Need immediate deployment bypass

**How to manually deploy:**
```bash
./deploy.sh
```

**What this does:**
- Triggers Vercel deployment via deploy hook
- Bypasses GitHub webhook
- Uses `.vercel-deploy-hook` file (gitignored, local only)
- Shows deployment status and Vercel dashboard link

**NEVER:**
- Use `vercel --prod` or `vercel deploy` commands (can hit rate limits)
- Manually redeploy from Vercel dashboard without user request
- Share or commit the `.vercel-deploy-hook` file (it's gitignored)

**After deployment:**
- Wait 30-60 seconds for build to complete
- Check: https://vercel.com/alexeystolybkos-projects/jumper/deployments
- Test the production URL to verify changes

## üîÑ CRITICAL: Concurrent Session Management
**Multiple Claude Code sessions may be running simultaneously. Follow these rules to prevent conflicts:**

1. **ALWAYS check git status FIRST** before making ANY changes
   - Run `git status` to see what files have been modified by other sessions
   - Run `git log -1` to see the latest commit and version number
   - If files are modified or version is newer than expected, STOP and inform the user

2. **ALWAYS pull latest changes BEFORE making edits**
   - Run `git pull` before starting any work
   - Read files fresh after pulling to ensure you have latest content
   - Never assume file contents are current from previous reads

3. **COORDINATE version numbers**
   - Check current version in game.js BEFORE suggesting next version
   - If another session incremented version, use the NEXT available version
   - Never reuse or overwrite a version number that's already committed

4. **AVOID simultaneous file edits**
   - If git status shows uncommitted changes to files you need to edit, WARN the user
   - Ask user which session should handle the changes
   - Consider using different files or coordinating with user about which session does what

5. **READ files immediately before editing**
   - Always Read tool right before Edit tool to get latest content
   - File may have been modified by other session between your last read and now
   - If Edit tool fails due to file modification, inform user about conflict

6. **Commit frequently to reduce conflict window**
   - Smaller, focused commits reduce chance of conflicts
   - Push immediately after committing
   - This makes your changes visible to other sessions faster

7. **If conflicts occur:**
   - STOP immediately and inform the user
   - Show what files are in conflict
   - Let user decide how to resolve (merge, discard, coordinate sessions)
   - NEVER force-push or resolve conflicts automatically

**Example workflow:**
```bash
# 1. Check status first
git status
git log -1

# 2. Pull latest
git pull

# 3. Read file fresh
Read game.js

# 4. Make your changes
Edit game.js

# 5. Commit and push quickly
git add .
git commit -m "..."
git push
```
